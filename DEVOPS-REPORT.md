## 2. DevOps Implementation

### Version Control
- System: Git
- Repository: GitHub
- Branching Strategy: Feature branch workflow
- Commit Convention: Conventional Commits

### Code Quality & Linting
- Tool: ESLint with TypeScript support
- Config Format: Flat config (eslint.config.js)
- Pre-commit Hooks: Husky + lint-staged
- Scripts:
  - npm run lint
  - npm run lint:fix
- CI Integration: Linting runs before tests

### Containerization
- Tool: Docker
- Builds: Multi-stage (Development & Production)
- Dev Environment: Node.js + Hot Reloading
- Prod Environment: Nginx-based static file server
- Orchestration: Docker Compose for dev and prod

### Testing
- Framework: Vitest + React Testing Library
- Test Types: Unit, Integration, Manual
- Test Environment: JSDOM + Docker containers

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Platform: GitHub Actions
- Stages:
  - Test → Build Docker Image → Push to Docker Hub
- Integration: Netlify auto-deploy from GitHub

### Hosting
- Platform: Netlify
- Build Command: npm run build
- Publish Directory: dist
- Environment Variables: Configured in Netlify UI

## 3. Deployment Workflow

### Local Development
1. Start dev container: docker-compose up dev
2. Code reloads automatically with Vite HMR
3. Run npm test for unit tests
4. Run npm run lint for code checks

### Production Deployment
1. Push code to main branch
2. GitHub Actions:
   - Runs linting and tests
   - Builds Docker image and pushes to Docker Hub
3. Netlify:
   - Pulls latest code
   - Builds and deploys app

## 4. Linting Implementation

### ESLint Configuration
Custom rules set in eslint.config.js:
```javascript
rules: {
  ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
  "react-refresh/only-export-components": "warn",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "warn",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "warn",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type": "warn",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports": "warn",
  "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn",
}
```

### Type Definitions
Centralized in src/types/JobTypes.ts:
```typescript
export type JobType = 'Full-time' | 'Part-time' | 'Contract' | 'Internship' | 'Remote' | string;

export type AuthUser = {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  user_metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  app_metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  [key: string]: unknown;
};
```

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration
.husky/pre-commit:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"
npx lint-staged
```

### Type Safety Upgrade
Before:
```typescript
profile: any | null;
```
After:
```typescript
import { AuthUser } from "@/types/JobTypes";
profile: AuthUser | null;
```

### Linting Benefits
- Early error detection
- Consistent code style
- Reduced technical debt
- Better readability
- Built-in documentation
- Increased productivity
- Quality control before deployment

## 5. Testing Implementation

### Unit Testing
Example: Button Component
```typescript
describe('Button Component', () => {
  test('renders button with text', () => {
    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);
    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test('calls onClick handler when clicked', async () => {
    const handleClick = vi.fn();
    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /click me/i }));
    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing
- Docker containers for environment parity
- Supabase auth mocking
- Authentication flow validation

### Manual Functional Testing
| Component | Tool / Method | Result |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Application Load | http://localhost:5173 | ✅ |
| Docker Containers | Docker Desktop | ✅ |
| Supabase Auth | Browser Flow | ✅ |
| Job Listings | UI Inspection | ✅ |
| Company Profiles | UI Inspection | ✅ |
| Page Navigation | Manual Click Test | ✅ |
| Form Validation | Manual Input Test | ✅ |
| Responsive Design | DevTools (Mobile/Desktop) | ✅ |
| App Build Process | Docker | ✅ |
| Linting Integration | ESLint Output | ✅ |

### Testing Benefits
- Functional verification
- Regression prevention
- Refactor with confidence
- Code-as-documentation
- Time-saving debug process
- CI/CD reliability

## 6. Environment Configuration

### Development
- Node.js 20.x (inside container)
- Vite dev server (with HMR)
- Environment variables via Docker Compose
- Live volume mounts
- ESLint integration

### Production
- Nginx server for SPA routing
- Static file optimization + caching
- Environment variables injected at build

## 7. Security Measures

| Layer | Security Features |
|-------|------------------|
| Docker | Multi-stage builds, Alpine base, minimal packages |
| Netlify | HTTPS, secure headers, secret management |
| App Code | Supabase auth, typed interfaces, dependency updates |

## 8. Performance Optimization

### Docker
- Layer caching
- Clean image builds
- Lean base images

### Frontend
- Code splitting
- Asset minification
- Static caching headers

## 9. Current Testing Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Component Unit Tests | ✅ Completed |
| Integration Tests | ✅ Basic |
| Manual Testing | ✅ Completed |
| CI Testing Integration | ✅ Active |
| Lint + Type Checks | ✅ Stable |

## 10. Definition of Done

Our team follows this simplified Definition of Done checklist to ensure consistent quality across all work:

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] Code passes ESLint checks with no errors
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined (no `any` types)
- [ ] Unit tests are written and passing
- [ ] Manual testing confirms functionality
- [ ] Docker containers build and run correctly
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by team member
- [ ] Documentation updated where necessary
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completes successfully

### DevOps Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Development environment works locally
- [ ] Production build functions correctly
- [ ] Configuration files are properly documented
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Security best practices followed
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

This straightforward checklist ensures all work meets our quality standards before being considered complete.

## 11. Future Recommendations

### Short-Term Goals
- Introduce Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Set up accessibility testing automation
- Add Lighthouse performance checks
- Strengthen linting and type strictness
- Build the recruiter side of the platform

### Long-Term Goals
- Containerized deployment on AWS/GCP
- Application monitoring and alerting tools
- Enable auto dependency updates (e.g., Renovate)
- Add Prettier for formatting consistency
